Installation
============

This should work on Windows, since ``opencv-python`` packages its own OpenCV. I cannot guarantee this, though, and I cannot help Windows users with configuration.::

  $ git clone https://github.com/downsmash/downsmash
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also probably want to use a video downloader such as ``yt-dlp``.
